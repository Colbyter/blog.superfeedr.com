There is not a week where we are not amazed by the possibilities offered by our [Tracker feeds](https://superfeedr.com/tracker). For example, by tracking mentions of *"superfeedr"* and links to [superfeedr.com](https://superfeedr.com/), we found [this](http://sdtimes.com/google-releases-cloud-vision-api-eff-makes-complaint-about-google-tracking-student-info-patent-shows-amazon-wants-to-do-something-with-ar-sd-times-news-digest-dec-3-2015/) and [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34229340/superfeedr-wont-reach-parse-com-callback-url) within minutes of their publications.

This is an **incredibly powerful API** which lets you filter the web in realtime for mentions and links by languages, popularity and more!

Unfortunately, like most APIs, it's not easily consumed by humans and will require some engineering and development work to integrate in a user workflow. This is the reason why we created [grep.io](https://grep.io/).

<blockquote>Grep emails you when your <span class="things"><span class="things__spacer">&nbsp;</span><span id="typed">business</span><span class="things__spacer">&nbsp;</span></span> is mentioned online.</blockquote>

Grep is an **email application** which sends you email when things you care about are mentioned on the web. We'd love to get your feedback, so head to [https://grep.io/](https://grep.io/), and use the <code>03-HAPPINESS</code> invite code. Beware, it expires in less than 3 days, so be quick!
