Track is definitely one of our "big priorities":http://blog.superfeedr.com/a-better-track/ of the moment as people love it! One of the primary concerns, is to *increase its search base*. 20M+ entries per day might not be enough for some of you, who want even more data.  Starting today, you can use "Superfeedr's track":http://superfeedr.com/documentation#track feature to get realtime *PubSubHubbub* notifications from *Google Buzz* for any entry that matches a given keyword.

Obviously, we're adding more and more PubSubHubbub content to Superfeedr so you can build awesome Track-based applications!

Also, don't forget, you can get this feed and any track feed either thru "XMPP":http://superfeedr.com/documentation#xmpp_pubsub or "PubSubHubbub":http://superfeedr.com/documentation#pubsubhubbub =D
