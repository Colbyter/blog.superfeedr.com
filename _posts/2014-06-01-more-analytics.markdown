Each superfeedr account, whether you're a subscriber or a publisher gets an analytics section where you can view interesting data about your account: the number of feeds, the number of subscriptions and the credits balance haven been displayed [since the begining](http://blog.superfeedr.com/real-time/analytics/pubsubhubbub/analytics-launched/).

In the last couple days, we have started keeping track of the number of notifications sent. This is quite convenient to see sudden changes, but also, for publishers to see if the data is sent to the subscribers. Publishers now also have a graph which shows the number of pings they sent to Superfeedr. Another convenient way to see if their pings are successfuly reaching us.
