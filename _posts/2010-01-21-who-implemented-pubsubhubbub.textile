Exactly like "last month":http://blog.superfeedr.com/Feeds/PubSubHubbub/real-time/stats/who-pubsubhubbub/, here is a _list of domains for which we have callback urls_ : *they implemented PubSubHubbub*! 

Let's start with the new kids in the room, who were not in the list last month, again, in absolutely no particular order: 
- "netvibes":http://www.netvibes.com/
- "tailsweep.com":http://www.tailsweep.com/
- "rss2twitter":http://rss2twitter.com/
- "fliptop-inc.com":http://fliptop-inc.com/
- "geowhy.org":http://geowhy.org/
- "sfr.fr":http://sfr.fr
- "viewsflow.com":http://viewsflow.com
- "chitthajagat.in":http://chitthajagat.in
- "tbablogs.com":http://tbablogs.com
- "webwag.com":http://www.webwag.com/startup/
- "nababu.org":http://nababu.org
- "pitchfork.com":http://pitchfork.com/

Obviously, all the "big guys from last time":http://blog.superfeedr.com/Feeds/PubSubHubbub/real-time/stats/who-pubsubhubbub/ are still here :)

In total, we now have 177 different domains with callback urls. This is very exciting!
