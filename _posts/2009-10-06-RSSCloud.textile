"Why make things simple when you can make them complex?". It was probably just too easy to have a common *open* protocol that everyone would share and use for push notifications of feed changes. At Superfeedr, we chose "PubSubHubbub":http://blog.superfeedr.com/api/http/pubsubhubbub/pubsubhubbub/, for "obvious reasons":http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/09/rsscloud-vs-pubsubhubbub-why-the-fat-pings-win/, and we're quite happy with it.

Yet, "some publishers":http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2009/09/07/rss-in-the-clouds/ have made a different choice and since _it always eventually comes down to the customer's experience_, we had to implement RSSCloud. Superfeedr is now an "aggregator":http://rsscloud.org/walkthrough.html. As a user, if you give us a feed that is RSSCloud enabled, then, we will subscribe to the right _cloud_ and you should get updates from this feed in a few seconds as well (exactly like with PubSubHubbub).

The awesome part of that news: since we use "PubSubHubbub as our API":http://push.superfeedr.com/ (we're one of the few independent hubs), this means that if you use us, _you don't even have to care about RSSCloud_. "Once again":http://blog.superfeedr.com/gospel/something-stupid/, we do all the "hard" work for you :) *Just implement the PubSubHubbub subscriber part, and you'll get the RSSCloud feeds through that as well*.
