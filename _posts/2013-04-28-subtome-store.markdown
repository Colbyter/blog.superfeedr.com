As the web now flourishes with new feed readers, we have decided to help that community by simplifying the subscription process as it is still extremely complex for a user to say "I want to know when there is new content here".

Today, we're excited to launch the [SubToMe Store](https://www.subtome.com/store.html). It's a list of web or mobile applications that users can use to subscribe to feeds on websites.

Of course, adding your app to the store is [one pull request away](https://github.com/superfeedr/subtome), so please, if you're working on an RSS consuming app, make sure you add yours, as well as don't forget to [add discovery](https://www.subtome.com/developers.html) for your users, so that they won't even have to add your apps!
