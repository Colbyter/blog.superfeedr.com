Welcome to the Superfeedr's blog. I am not sure what you expect from here. You know what a geek does when he's embarrassed does, right? He gets into technical details.

This blog has been built with the great piece of code that Jekyll is. It is hosted on Github, and I used TextMate Version 1.5.8 (1498) to write it. I also used Git to push it on our Github repository. TextMate runs on my MacBookPro 2.53 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo, with 4 GB of DD3 RAM. It's about 85Â° F in the room in which I am working right now.

Welcome!
