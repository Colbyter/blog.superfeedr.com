I am a bit ashamed that this comes so late... but it's always better late than never : we have a rack middleware for Superfeedr.

What it does is simple : subscribe, unsubscribe and help you handle notifications by hiding all the PubSubHubbub -complexity- magic. 

Since it's Rack, it should work with any Ruby web framework that supports Rack.

Here is a small example that you can play with right away!

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1644799.js?file=superfeedr-sinatra.rb"></script>

Get it while it's hot: `gem install rack-superfeedr`, and check the code on "github":https://github.com/superfeedr/rack-superfeedr. If you build something awesome, please let us know and we'll link to it.

As you can see it's quite elegant :) Can't wait to show you how to run that with our "Heroku Addon":https://gist.github.com/1585628! if you want to be among the very first testers. Please let us know!
