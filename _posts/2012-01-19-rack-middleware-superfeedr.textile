I am a bit ashamed that this comes so late... but it's always better late than never: we have a "rack middleware for Superfeedr":http://rubygems.org/gems/rack-superfeedr.

What it does is simple: *subscribe*, *unsubscribe* and help you *handle notifications* by hiding all the "PubSubHubbub":http://documentation.superfeedr.com/subscribers.html#webhooks -complexity- magic. Since it's Rack, it should work with any Ruby web framework that supports Rack, including Rails and Sinatra.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1644799.js?file=superfeedr-sinatra.rb"></script>

Get it while it's hot: <code>gem install rack-superfeedr</code>, and check the code on "github":https://github.com/superfeedr/rack-superfeedr. If you build something awesome, please let us know and we'll link to it.

As you can see it's quite elegant :) Can't wait to show you how to run that with our "Heroku Addon":https://gist.github.com/1585628! if you want to be among the very first testers. Please let us know!
