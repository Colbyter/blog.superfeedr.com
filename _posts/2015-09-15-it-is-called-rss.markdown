A couple weeks ago, [we rejoiced about the fact](http://blog.superfeedr.com/apple-facebook-rss/) that **both** Facebook and Apple, which have been notoriously known as *closed platforms* and players have been promoting the use of RSS as an ingestion mechanism for their Instant Aricle and News products. When doing this, they joined companies like [Flipboard](http://flipboard.com/) which have been laying the work for a [new kind of web browser](http://www.ouvre-boite.com/new-browsers/) for a long time.

It's not a surprise that a couple days ago, the Google and Twitter (the 2 faux-open champions) [leaked that](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/12/technology/google-twitter-and-publishers-seek-faster-web.html) they were working together on *creat[ing] a new kind of web link and article storage system that would load online news articles and digital magazine pieces in a few milliseconds*.

The article continues with

> The effort is also an attempt to protect the web from the onslaught of mobile applications and steer publishers away from the **closed, proprietary systems** that are being built by companies like Facebook, Apple and Snapchat.

Hum. I have no idea if Facebook or Apple are *actually* using RSS feeds, mostly because their products still have a very limited scope or have not even been launched... However, I know a **format which is completely open**. It's also an industry standard adopted by *all* major new outlets. **It's called RSS** and comes with a great realtime distribution mechanism: [PubSubHubbub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubSubHubbub).

[We have been helping companies](https://superfeedr.com/) ingest RSS content for years now and we'd be more than happy to help save time for the smart engineers at Google and Twitter who are probably working on **re-inventing a wheel that spins already pretty well**! Also, we (the RSS community) would love to hear from them and have them help us **improve RSS** rather than just scrape years of efforts and achievements!
