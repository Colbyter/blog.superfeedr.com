title: Reporting Chrome Application Errors
categories: [meta]
---

The "msgboy":http://msgboy.com is Chrome Application, and like all Chrome applications, it's _written in Javascript_. Coming from the Ruby world, we really love "Airbrakeapp":http://airbrakeapp.com/pages/home (previously known as Hoptoadapp), and we missed it when we started rolling out the msgboy.

For those unfamiliar with it, *Airbrakeapp is a bug tracking tool*. It collects errors generated by other applications, and aggregates the results for review. It was initially built mostly for Ruby on Rails applications, however, there is no reason to expect that it would only work with that platform.
As a matter of fact, it "has a great API":http://help.airbrakeapp.com/kb/api-2/notifier-api-version-21 that you could theoretically implement in any language. As a matter of fact, the Airbrakeapp Rails plugin comes with a JS snippet for the errors in your Rails views.

We have taken that snippet, cleaned it up a bit, and simplified a bunch of things so that it works great in any Chrome application.

Like always, feel free to fork it, and improve it!
