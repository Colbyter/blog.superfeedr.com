Yesterday, the Carsonified team relaunched their website and it's looking great. The "Mission page":http://carsonified.com/mission/ should be a lesson for everybody:

bq. At Carsonified we believe in treating other people like we want to be treated: with *friendliness, patience and respect*. We believe that the web industry is one of the most exciting places in the world, and that *it's an honor for us to connect, encourage and train that community through our events*. We believe in being more creative than we need to be and having fun while we're at it.
