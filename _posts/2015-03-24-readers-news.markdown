We're often asked to show case simple applications built using Superfeedr. People also ask us how easy it would be to build a feed reader using Superfeedr. Of course, there are thounsands of ways to build feed reader, but we thought we'd share one very simple example for such an app and we build [Reader News](http://readers-ne.ws/) which is a feed reader about... feed readers!

It's extremely basic but shows exactly how you can use Superfeedr to aggregate feeds and show their content inside a static ReactJS application. The [code is public](https://github.com/superfeedr/readernews) and we commented it so that you can easily build a more complex application from it.

Also, we take great pride in the fact that its HTML is barely 50 lines and the JS application is just *62 lines* too: building RSS applications with Superfeedr is both lightweight and elegant!
