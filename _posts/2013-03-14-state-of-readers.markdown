So [Google Reader is shutting down](http://googlereader.blogspot.fr/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html). This is obviously worrisome, mostly because the *deprecation schedule is tight*. But this is also a great news because Google Reader stopped innovating 5 years ago and yet was still the most visible RSS reader out there. 

When people said RSS was dead, a lot of them were just expressing the fact that Google Reader was a zombie.

Believe it or not, we had this post in the pipes for a couple weeks. 
The initial reason for it was to get an exhaustive overview of the many readers out there to convince them they should use [SubToMe](https://www.subtome.com/), but this deserves another post.

There are actually **a ton of readers** and I'll focus on the web ones, because the web is my thing.

> **UPDATE** There is indeed a LOT of readers and I've been contacted by many people to add theres. Please, make sure you read the comments too as they include a bunch of other suggestions

### Msgboy

First, I'd like to point Google Chrome users toward [Msgboy](http://www.msgboy.com/index.html) which is our own in-house attempt.
It's obviously plugged to Superfeedr (realtime FTW), and will only store your data in your browser. 

It's also [completely open source](https://github.com/superfeedr/msgboy) and you can import your data from Google Reader :)

We hope to have a Firefox version very soon. Feel free to get in touch if you think you can help :) 

### Google Reader and the Google Reader based services

By all counts Google reader is/was the most popular RSS Reader out there. What's even more interesting is that many other services, like [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com/) relied on its API. It's worth mentionning [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) too. These services will have to find an alternative to Reader's API, Superfeedr can help =)

### The alternatives

In the past couple weeks, we have seen dozens of new initiatives in this area. Let's do a quick summary.

#### Bloglovin

[Bloglovin](http://www.bloglovin.com/) is probably the *only popular reader outside of the tech crowd*. It's UI is probably closer to the Tumblr dashboard and the popular tabs tells more about its userbase than anything else: fashion, scrapping, food....

In other words, it's the proof that you do not need to be a tech nerd to use and enjoy a feed reader. 

#### NewsBlur

<img src="../images/newblur-stats.png" alt="Msgboy" style="float:right; margin: 10px"> 

[NewsBlur](http://www.newsblur.com/) is on the other side of the spectrum in terms of users: it's a very advanced web reader which has been here for a couple years. We love the insight it gives in stories.

Its business model is clear (freemium), which makes it a viable alternative in the long run. 


#### The Old Reader

[The old Reader](http://theoldreader.com/) is a very recent readers. Its UI will sound familiar to anyone who's been using Google Reader because, well it's explicitly inspired from it. Yet, it does a very good job and this is one of my favorite attempts.

#### Feedspot

[Feedspot](http://feedspot.com/) is another Google Reader looking alternative.

#### Netvibes

[Netvibes](http://www.netvibes.com/) was the most popular reader a couple years back. Even though it *moved away from beeing a pure feed reader* a long time ago, it still offers these features and may be worth a look if you like its UI.

There are more, like [Feedbooster](http://feeds.qsensei.com/) that I've been either unable to use or which seem quite abandonned. I'd love to add to that list if you leave a link in the comments :)

### Plaform Owned

#### Wordpress's Reader

[Wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com/) has a beautiful Reader, which works really well, and it's federated, which means that **you can subscribe to feeds from other sources/platforms**, like say Tumblr. 
I wish though that it offered permanent URLs, so it could be used with [SubToMe](https://www.subtome.com/). 

Looks like very few people around me know about that reader though.

I wish other platforms (I'm looking at you [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/dashboard)) which already offer some kind of reader, offered it in a federated way. *Why can't I follow non-tumblr sites in my Tumblr?*

### Self Hosted

#### Feedafever

[Feedafever](http://www.feedafever.com/) is a beautiful self hosted platform. It sold with a $30 fee and then you can run it on your own server.

#### Netflix's RSS reader

[Netflix's RSS reader](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/introducing-first-netflixoss-recipe-rss.html) was released earlier this week by Netflix. I'm not sure whether this is a true product or just aimed at being a demo, but it may be worth a try!

#### Cartulary

[Cartulary](https://github.com/daveajones/cartulary) is web reader developed by Dave Jones to be hosted on Amazon EC2.

### Consuming RSS in other ways

Who said you need a dedicated app to consume RSS feeds?

#### IFTTT

[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) is my favorite web automation tool. It has a lot or RSS recipes which can ease your RSS consumption a lot!
For example, [this recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/83992) will push the content of an RSS feed to you pocket account. 

#### Blogtrottr

[Blogtrottr](http://blogtrottr.com/) is an RSS to Email service. It allows you to subscribe to feeds and get email when they update. Simple, convenient for those who don't susbcribe to more than a couple feeds and don't want to use yet another service.
 
#### Notifixlite

[Notifixlite](notifixlite.appspot.com) is a simple RSS to IM service that [we](http://superfeedr.com/) created. Just subscribe to feeds from your chat client nad receive notifications when they update.

### Will Google be back?

One of Google's argument being the end of Reader is the need for them to focus on less services. Google+ is probably one of the few things that Google wants to keep. When you think about it, **Google+, like Facebook and Twitter are some kind of reader**. You <del>subscribe</del> follow people or even brands, and then get to publish to your stream.

Now, I asked some Googlers why they would not allow (with the right UI, of course) people to follow RSS feeds in their Google+. The response was that Google already had an RSS reader: Google Reader. Well, not anymore.
Maybe one day, RSS will come back to Google via Google+ ?
