title: "How can we help the open web?"

Today is thanksgiving in the USA. It's a holliday in where you *celebrate others and thank them for the help they provided*. Of course, we want to thank everyone in our community: our customers, developers, partners and investors. It's a pleasure to be working with you and we hope to keep doing that for a long time.

However, we also want to take a couple words to **thank everyone who's building the open web**, every developer, indie or not that's making the web a better place to interract with each other. 

> Fighting for the open web is not an easy feat and every day is a new battle to make sure the web giants don't own the web, our personal data and our relationships. 

It's not obvious, but there are a ton of projects which contribute to the open web: popular things like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), which anyone can use to make a consistent-looking interface, controversial protocols, like [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/en/) who can simplify the way people pay for our services and apps, fast growing services which simplify how developers can build the web... or even [small libraries](https://github.com/node-xmpp/node-xmpp) on Github.

We also know that, even it's a priceless, sometimes, **'thank you' is not enough**. There are open web projects which are stuck because they tripped on a road block too big for the small team working on them. There are open web projects that have a hard time getting attention because whoever is in charge of them is not the stereotypical developer. There are open web projects looking for a couple donations to pay for their hosting and bandwidth.

We want to help these projects. [Superfeedr](http://superfeedr.com) is a cashflow positive machine that's built using open web libraries, protocols and software: it's time that we give back.

If there is anything we can do to help: review code, fix bugs, write posts, help get introductions... etc, please, feel free to let us know.
