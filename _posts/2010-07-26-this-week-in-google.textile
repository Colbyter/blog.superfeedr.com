If you're not listening to any of "Leo":http://twit.tv/'s shows, you're certainly missing a few of the best online shows of these days. Leo and his hosts get the web and the "last episode to date":http://twit.tv/twig52 of "ThisWeekInGoogle":http://twit.tv/twig (happy birthday) is just the best proof.

"Jyri":http://twitter.com/Jyri was on last week's show and he did a great job explaining Superfeedr, but this is really one of the many awesome topics in this podcast. Don't miss the part on _data privacy_, the part on _data resyndication_. I think they are spot on.
