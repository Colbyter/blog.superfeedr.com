Branding is the most important aspect of any tech company. After our redesign last year, we decided to sit with an internationaly recognized consulting firm and assess our brand and the messages it conveys. 

After working very hard for weeks and weeks and we came up with a new name and logo. We hope you'll apprciate it.

<strong>Update</strong>: of course, yesterday was April 1st :) For the sake of eternity, here's s screen capture of Batfeedr!
