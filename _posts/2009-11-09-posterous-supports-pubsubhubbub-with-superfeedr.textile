We're very excited to say that "Posterous":http://posterous.com/ now *supports PubSubHubbub* and became *real-time*! If you've got a posterous blog (and you should!), your posts will now show up in real-time in any feed reader that supports PubSubHubbub on the subscriber side.

What's even better (for us), is that the Posterous chose to use our "publisher services":http://superfeedr.com/publisher for that, and *their hub is hosted at Superfeedr* at the following address : "http://posterous.superfeedr.com/":http://posterous.superfeedr.com/

We're working hard to have more and more publishers support this awesome protocol and it's great that the Posterous team (which I met recently) is paving the way.

If you're a "Superfeedr subscriber":http://superfeedr.com/subscriber user, _there is nothing you need to do, you'll receive Posterous feeds in real-time too_ :)
