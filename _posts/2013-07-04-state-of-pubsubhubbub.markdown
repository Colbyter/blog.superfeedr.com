title: "State of PubSubHubbub (subscribers' edition)"
---

Now that [PubSubHubbub evolved toward 0.4](http://blog.superfeedr.com/pubsubhubbub-04/), and that what used to be the most popular reader are gone, it's time to check the **state of PubSubHubbub** and see which of the new readers support it.

We've picked the most popular web based readers from [this list](http://alternativeto.net/software/google-reader/) and we tested PubSubHubbub support on a feed that supports it, thru the Superfeedr [PubSubHubbub Community hub](http://pubsubhubbub.superfeedr.com/) (open to everyone!).

If your reader is missing from that list, please let us know in the comments, subscribe to [that feed](http://push-pub.appspot.com/feed) and let us know in the comments when that's done. We'll tell you if your reader supports *PubSubHubbub*.

### Supporting PubSubHubbub

* [Feedly](http://cloud.feedly.com/#latest): supported
* [NewsBlur](http://www.newsblur.com/): supported
* [Inoreader](http://www.inoreader.com/): supported
* [The Old Reader](http://theoldreader.com/): supported
* [Flipboard](http://flipboard.com/): supported
* [Commafeed](https://www.commafeed.com): supported
* [BazQux](https://www.bazqux.com/): supported


### Not (yet!) support PubSuHubbub

* [NetVibes](http://www.netvibes.com/): this is sad because they used to support PubSubHubbub a couple years ago.
* [Digg Reader](http://digg.com/reader): I heard from the team at Digg that it's on their TODO list. The earlier the better Digg!
* [Pulse](http://www.pulse.me/): they are subscribed to some feeds on some superfeedr hubs, but I could not get them to subscribe to my test feed. 
* [AOL Reader](http://reader.aol.com/): not supported. Could not get in touch with anyone working on it :(
* [BlogLovin](http://www.bloglovin.com/): not yet, but we bugged them to add support soon!
* [FeedBin](https://feedbin.me/): not yet.

All in all, these are pretty good results. The 6 **supporters** are also the 6 most popular readers. Since *latency is key feature* for most readers (who wants to read today's news tomorrow?), we hope that they'll add support soon too, and we're more than happy to help.

### Publishers, make your feeds PubSubHubbub!

Readers are not the only apps consuming your feeds. Did you know that search engines consume them too? For example, Matt Cutts [said that Google uses PuSH](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LsB19wTt0Q) to detect original content faster.

There are also apps like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/dashboard) or [UrbanAirship](http://urbanairship.com/) who support the protocol to propagate updates faster to their users.

It's simpler than most people think and we would be thrilled to [host your hub](http://superfeedr.com/publisher), for free.
