For the past few months, one of our projects involved working on an Heroku addon. Today it reached public beta. In a nutshell, it allows for anyone using Heroku to *integrate* with all of Superfeedr's features with minimal effort: all the provisioning, integration and even billing is managed thru Heroku.


h2. Integrating

!{float: right; margin: 5px;}/images/heroku.png!

The first step is to _add_ the Superfeedr addon to your existing application. Like for most Heroku addon, type this in your application's repository:

<code>heroku addons:add superfeedr</code>

The next step is the most important step: picking up the right API to use:

* The "XMPP PubSub":http://superfeedr.com/documentation#xmpp_pubsub may require you to run an extra Dyno (process), and XMPP may not have good libraries for your language of choice.
* The "PubSubHubbub":http://superfeedr.com/documentation#pubsubhubbub API uses webhooks, which means that your development machine will need to be 'accessible' from outside the firewall.

Then, you can start implementing! When making calls to Superfeedr, make sure you use <code>SUPERFEEDR_LOGIN</code> and <code>SUPERFEEDR_PASSWORD</code> as your credentials. (you can also set these environment variables to your local development machine)

h2. Billing

For now, using the "Superfeedr heroku addon":https://addons.heroku.com/superfeedr is free, but we will soon introduce plans. These plans will obviously include a *free version*, but they will be based on the number of feeds (we exclude track feeds though), rather than the number of entries. This has been a rather frequent request for superfeedr and we may use Heroku as a sandbox for a new superfeedr pricing model.

If you're looking at sample applications, check this "node.js example":https://github.com/superfeedr/superfeedr-node-sample _which uses XMPP_, "Superpipes":https://github.com/superfeedr/superpipes, or this "Sinatra application":https://github.com/superfeedr/rack-superfeedr/blob/master/examples/sinatra_app.rb, which uses PubSubHubbub.

Happy coding!
