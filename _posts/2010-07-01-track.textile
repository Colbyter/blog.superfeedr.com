Ever wondered how you could subscribe to keywords, instead of actual feeds? It's already _great to get pushed content from thousands of RSS feeds_, but sometimes, you want to know all about your company's name, all about movie that's just been released. A long long long time ago, "Twitter":http://twitter.com/ had its "own track":http://blog.twitter.com/2007/09/tracking-twitter.html. It was basically Twitter search inside your twitter stream, so that the results which matched your searches would be pushed to you, like tweets from your friends.

Today, there is *Superfeedr's track*. It's a *simple way to get all the Atom entries matching a given keyword pushed to your app*.  

Once again, we hide all the complexity from you, and you can use the exact same API calls that you're used too, whether it's with the "XMPP PubSub":http://superfeedr.com/documentation#xmpp_pubsub endpoint or the "PubSubHubbub":http://superfeedr.com/documentation#pubsubhubbub protocol. Are you tracking music as a keyword? subscribe to @http://superfeedr.com/track/music@. And yes, it works with any keyword like this : http://superfeedr.com/track/@<keyword>@.

Looking for a few apps that were built in less than 24 hours with Track? Check out this "friendfeed page":http://friendfeed.com/trackmusic : it shows the track feed for the keyword _Music_. "RSSFall":http://www.rssfall.com/sf/ by "@jalada":http://twitter.com/jalada allows you to specify the keywords you want to track! Try out _soccer_, _worldcup_, _iphone_.. etc :) Want the results into your IM client? Check "Harper's":http://harperreed.org/ "SuperTrackr":http://www.supertrackr.com/, just add @supertrackr@appspot.com@ to your contacts if you use gtalk, then, enter @/track music@ and start dancing!

The results are taken from the more than 2M feeds that Superfeedr filters in realtime, as soon as the entries are published. These feeds include the feeds from the publishers who designated Superfeedr as their PubSubHubbub hub, like "Six Apart":http://hubbub.api.typepad.com/, "Tumblr":http://tumblr.superfeedr.com/, "Posterous":http://posterous.superfeedr.com/, "Gowalla":http://gowalla.superfeedr.com/, "Huffington Post":http://huffingtonpost.superfeedr.com/, "Gawker Media":http://gawker.superfeedr.com/ and more than 800 other big and small publishers, as well as the data from thousands of subscribers who offloaded their feed polling to Superfeedr.

We want more feeds! If you're a publisher, "start using us a a hub":http://superfeedr.com/publisher, and if your app polls feeds, stop doing it, it's dangerous, "have us push them to you":http://superfeedr.com/subscriber.

Today is also the day when we start counting how much data we send to subscribers, which means that you'll soon receive an email saying that _you'll need to buy credits if you want to keep receiving the notifications from the default hub_. It's not fun, but we're now confident enough with our service that we think it makes sense for us to move on to the next step. Obviously this doesn't mean that the service is perfect, it means that *your money will help us make it better*. We will add everyone with 25,000 credits, so you can get free 25,000 notifications from us, as with any new account.

*One last thing!*
As you've probably seen, "the website's design":http://superfeedr.com/ is changing... at least now it's done by someone whose work is to design websites! Please bear with us as we put a little more paint here and there, but again, it's moving in the right direction.

As always, your feedback is much much appreciated!
